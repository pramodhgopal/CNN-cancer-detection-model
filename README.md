Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict cancer from images of cells


This project delves into the exciting domain of medical image analysis, harnessing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address the pressing issue of cancer identification. We aim to create a robust binary image classification system capable of discerning between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue patches extracted from larger digital pathology scans.

In this project, we will explore the intricacies of CNNs, a class of deep learning models uniquely suited for image analysis tasks, and demonstrate their effectiveness in the context of medical image classification. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques in deep learning and utilizing a dataset comprising annotated pathology images, we endeavor to build a robust model capable of assisting pathologists in their crucial work.

The rest of this report will be structured as follows: we will delve into the methodology, data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics employed in the pursuit of our goal.
